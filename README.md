# Python
<p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.</p>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>

<h2>It is used for:</h2>

- web development (server-side)
- software development
- mathematics
- system scripting.

<h2>Python Features</h2>
<p>Python's features include −</p>

- **Easy-to-learn** - Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly. 
- **Easy-to-read** − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
- **Easy-to-maintain** - Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
- **A broad standard library** − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
- **Interactive Mode** − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
- **Portable** − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
- **Extendable**  − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
- **Databases** − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
- **GUI Programming** − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
- **Scalable** − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.

**Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below −**

- It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
- It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
- It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
- It supports automatic garbage collection.
- It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.

<h2>Why Python?</h2>

- Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
- Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
- Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
- Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
- Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.
